## Setting up your python environment *before the workshop*

<!--The workshop will be in a blended learning environment and hands-on. You will need a working installation of MDAnalysis and related packages including data to analyze in order to participate. The full installation may take up to about 1 GB of space (mostly for data, which you can delete after the workshop).--> 

Instructions for setting up your environment to run this workshop locally
are provided in [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md).

A full list of the required Python packages can be seen inside [`environment.yml`](environment.yml).

As downloading and installing everything will take a little while, ideally you should follow these steps before the workshop starts. If you encounter any issues during installation, we can help!

## Google Colab

If for any reason you cannot set up a local environment with all required packages, you can use Google Colab to run all workshop notebooks directly from your browser, no installation required. 

## Course pre-requisites

The course assumes that attendees have a working knowledge of [Jupyter notebooks][1], Python (especially the [NumPy library][2]), and the bash shell.
